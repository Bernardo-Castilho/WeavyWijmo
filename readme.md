# ASP.NET WeavyWijmo
An ASP.NET Core application with a React UI.

The app uses ASP.NET for user authentication, and shows how you
can get information about the user to create JWT tokens for use
with Weavy.

For details, see the **WeavyTokenController** class, which 
creates JWT tokens based on a user ID.

The UI part of the app uses React, Weavy, and Wijmo.
