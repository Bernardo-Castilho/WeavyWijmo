# ASP.NET WeavyWijmo
An ASP.NET Core application with a React UI.

The app uses ASP.NET for user authentication, and shows how you
can get information about the user to create JWT tokens for use
with Weavy.

For details, see the **WeavyTokenController** class, which 
creates JWT tokens based on a user ID.

The UI part of the app uses React, Weavy, and Wijmo.

This app was created using Visual Studio 2022 
(new project, ASP.NET Core with React.js template).

To run the app, load it in Visual Studio 2022 and press F5.

This app was created to help you get started in the 
[Weavy/Wijmo Hackathon](https://www.weavy.com/hackathonwijmo).
